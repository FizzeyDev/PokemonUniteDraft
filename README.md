## About

This website was created by a player, for players, with the goal of helping anyone who wants to practice and improve their drafting skills in Pok√©mon Unite.

Built with HTML/CSS and enhanced with a custom JavaScript script, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages.

This is a personal passion project, maintained for fun, but it will be kept up to date with the latest additions and balance changes in Pok√©mon Unite ‚Äî covering both casual and competitive formats.
